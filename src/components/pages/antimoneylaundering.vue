            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 40px;">Money laundering is the attempt to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership or control of illegally obtained money. Money laundering is most commonly associated with tax avoidance. However, other individuals may attempt to launder money in order to conceal their identity or finance their operations. 'Suspicious activity' is a very difficult concept to define because it can vary from one transaction to another based upon all the circumstances surrounding the transaction or group of transactions. For example, transactions by one customer may be normal based on our knowledge of that customer and their pattern of activity, while similar transactions by another customer may be suspicious. Many factors are involved in determining whether transactions are suspicious including the amount, the nature of the transaction and frequency of deposits/withdrawals from the system. xprintxchange is committed to fighting money laundering and complying fully with anti-money laundering laws in the Nigeria. We understand that we have responsibilities to help fight the global battle against money laundering and our commitment will supersede all other privacy obligations contained in our policies. Accordingly, xprintxchange will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to prevent persons engaged in money laundering, fraud, or other financial crimes from utilizing our products and services.
